# Manual Update

Copy all new files on the server except for a few files and folders with custom data. Usually those are:

- Every file in the `config/` folder that you changed, usually:
  - `config/app.php`
  - `config/saito_config.php`
- `webroot/useruploads`


Don't forget invisible files like `.htaccess` in the root folder.
