# User Map #

[The user map][webroot:users/map] shows all users who have marked a location in their [user profile][webroot:users/edit/:uid]. The map is accessible for registered members only.

Location data is rounded on output (latitude and longitude to 2 decimal places). Thus map markers are only precise within a few hundred meters/feet.
