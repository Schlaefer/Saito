# Simple Search #

Searches for one or more words. Wrapping into quotes "" searches for an exact phrase. Appending a star to a word * serves as a wildcard operator.

Words must have a minimum length (usually 4 characters).

# Advanced Search #

Is slower but allows a more detailed query and has no minimum character restriction. All text input is treated as phrase.
