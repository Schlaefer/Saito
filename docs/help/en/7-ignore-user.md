## Ignore Users ##

A logged-in user is able to ignore an other member in this member's profile. The postings of an ignored member are hidden if possible.

In a member-profile there are two informations (if applicable):

- a member sees in its own profile which users he blocks (non-public)
- the number of users who decided to ignore this member (public)

Ignored users are automatically unignored after three months.
