## Drafts

Drafts prevent the loss of content when composing a new posting.

The content is regularly saved in the background. If there's a problem (e.g. browser-crash) the saved content can be restored later. To do so start a new posting at the same place and an available draft will be inserted automatically.

The current status is indicated by an icon:

- <i class="fa fa-pencil" aria-hidden="true"></i> &nbsp; unsaved changes
- <i class="fa fa-floppy-o" aria-hidden="true"></i> &nbsp; saved

After a successful posting the draft is deleted. All drafts are considered abandoned after 30 days and deleted automatically.
