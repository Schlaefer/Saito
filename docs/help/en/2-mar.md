## Mark as Read (MAR) ##

The forum differentiates postings as read or unread. The state is indicated by different color in the thread view.

For non-logged-in users this is managed on per browser basis (Cookie). For logged-in users the state is saved on the server; this allows a consistent state across multiple devices.

## Read on Click ##

Viewing a single entry marks the entry as read. Opening a thread in mix-view marks all entries in that thread as read.

## Manual Mark as Read (mMAR) ##

The double-arrow button on top of the homepage marks all current entries as read.

## Intelligent Mark as Read (iMAR) ##


	          10:00         10:05
	---- A ---->|<---- B ---->|
	           t_1           t_2	   

Imagine the following: at 10:00 (t_1) someone visits the forum and reads entry A. At 10:05 (t_2) the mMAR button is clicked to mark A as read. But entry B – made between 10:00 and 10:05 – is also marked as read, even if it's not read.

A better solution would be to only mark entry A but not B as read. This is that iMAR is doing. If iMAR is activated in the user-preferences a click on the homepage's forum-logo will intelligently mark entries as read.
