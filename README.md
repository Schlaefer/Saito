PhileCMS
========

A file-based CMS with a swappable parser, template engine, cache and storage services, error handler, and meta parser.

[Check out the starter video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GLMe371RuI), or [read the wiki for in-depth documentation](https://github.com/PhileCMS/Phile/wiki/_pages).

## Why use PhileCMS?

Here is a small list of differences in design from typical flat-file CMSs:

* OOP based (classes)
* [Events system](https://github.com/PhileCMS/Phile/wiki/%5BDEVELOPER%5D-Event-System)
* [Uses Composer](https://github.com/PhileCMS/Phile/blob/master/composer.json)
* Overload core modules (plugins)
    * Parser (default: [Markdown](https://github.com/michelf/php-markdown))
    * Template Engine (default: [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/))
    * Cache (default: [phpFastCache](https://github.com/khoaofgod/phpfastcache))
    * Error handler (default: system handler)
    * Meta parser (default: system parser)
    * Simple Data Persistence (default: system data storage)
* Per-Plugin `config.php` files
* *Namespaced plugins* so classes can have the same name
* [PSR-0 Compliant](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-0.md)

## Installation

##### Requirements

* PHP `>=5.3`
* Apache with `mod_rewrite` enabled
* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) (unless you use `git` and `zip` files for everything)

[Install via composer](https://github.com/PhileCMS/Phile/wiki/%5BHOW-TO%5D-Installation#installation---method-two-the-nerd-way) or clone (download) this repo and extract into your server web root.

Open the root of PhileCMS on you web server. If you are using MAMP, that would be [http://localhost:8888/Phile](http://localhost:8888/Phile). Using WAMP, [http://localhost/Phile](http://localhost/Phile). If you are using something else, you probably know how to run a typical PHP site.

On first run you will hit a setup page. **Follow the instructions to complete the installation**.

## Plugins

Phile can be extended with a wide variety of plugins. You can also overwrite the default plugins in order to add extra functionality, speed, or features.

Once a plugin is installed, you then need to enable it. Check out the [default_config.php](https://github.com/PhileCMS/Phile/blob/release/1.0.0/default_config.php#L19) for some examples.

##### With composer

To install via composer, you would run:

```php
composer require phile/rss-feed:dev-master
```

##### With git

While sitting in your root PhileCMS folder, you can run:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/PhileCMS/phileRSSFeed plugins/phile/rssFeed
```

##### You've downloaded the .zip

You can clone or download the plugin into the `plugins/{namespace}/{pluginClassName}` folder. **Example**: [phileAdmin](https://github.com/james2doyle/phileAdmin) would be installed into `plugins/phile/adminPanel`.
