# Saito

##	What is it

Saito is an open source threaded web forum written in PHP (atop of [CakePHP] and [Marionette]).

Test the [demo install][testforum] (login: test/test; instance may need a few seconds to ramp up) or see production sites like [macnemo.de] or [macfix.de].

## Why

We had the need for a classic threaded forum but with modern, maintainable and extendable source.

It should be deployable on simple shared hosting accounts.
