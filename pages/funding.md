{{funding}}

All donation made after 2014-06-01 will fund the next release.

Features planed for the next version:

## Two Factor Authentication ##

Protect your account with [two factor authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication). Use a third party App like [Duo Mobile](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.duosecurity.duomobile) or [Google Authenticator](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8) as a second factor to improve your security when logging in.

You don't have to enter your security token manually. The forum will provide a QR-Code you will be able to scan with your mobile device!

## User Blocking ##

Someone is really annoying at the moment? Block up to three users at the same time. After one month the users will be unblocked automatically again.

Let somebody know when he lost it: every user profile will show how many people block that user at the moment.
