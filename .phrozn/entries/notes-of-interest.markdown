# Notes

The forum was originally designed to run on a [mylittleforum ][mlf] 1.x database *at same time* as [mylittleforum][mlf]. If you encounter WTF: consider if it makes sense in that context â€¦ and then fix it!

Because it was originally build for [macnemo.de][macnemo] it is still partly customized for it. This  includes the german localization and explains the incomplete english one.

So, there are some quirks (and a dragon) in it.
