Saito 4.5.0 continues the trend to move functionality into plugins and making the core more extendable.

The markup-parser is now a plugin. The BBCode-parser is going to stay the default parser, but it's easy now to swap BBCode for AsciiDoc, Markdown â€¦ .

Other plugins are removed from the Saito distribution and [available separately](saito-plugins).
