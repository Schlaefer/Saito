h3. Usage

To use the helper, include the helper in your controller:

	var $helpers = array('Geshi.Geshi');

In your views you can use @$this->Geshi->highlight($text);@ to highlight a block of text inside some HTML. By default the helper will highlight any @<pre>@ block and convert it into highlighted code.
