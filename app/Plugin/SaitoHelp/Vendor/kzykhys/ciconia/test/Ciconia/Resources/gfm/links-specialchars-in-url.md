[GFM][] will [autolink](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown#url-autolinking) standard URLs, so if you want to link to a URL (instead of setting link text),
you can simply enter the URL like http://hello.world?_t=a and it will be turned into a link to that URL.

Internally, the URL will be turned into <http://example.com/>.
